## Launching the demo

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/smithara/swarmpal-demo/HEAD?labpath=SwarmPAL%2Fdocs%2Ftoolboxes%2Ftfa%2Fusing_tfa.ipynb)

Click the button above to launch the demo (on mybinder.org)

This sets up a temporary environment containing an editable install of the latest version of [SwarmPAL](https://github.com/Swarm-DISC/SwarmPAL)

## Finding the demo notebooks

Once JupyterLab has loaded, you can use the file browser on the left to navigate to `SwarmPAL/docs/toolboxes/` and select a notebook.

Or use these links (though they may be outdated):
- [Shared Components](./SwarmPAL/docs/toolboxes/shared/data_io.ipynb)
- [FAC](./SwarmPAL/docs/toolboxes/fac/using_fac.ipynb)
- [DSECS](./SwarmPAL/docs/toolboxes/secs/using_secs.ipynb)
- [TFA](./SwarmPAL/docs/toolboxes/tfa/using_tfa.ipynb)

These notebooks are also used to generate parts of [the online documentation](https://swarmpal.readthedocs.io)

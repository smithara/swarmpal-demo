# swarmpal-demo

## Launching the demo

**If you are not already in Jupyter**, click either:
- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/smithara/swarmpal-demo/HEAD) to launch the demo on mybinder.org
- VRE link to-do

The Binder link sets up a temporary environment containing an editable install of the latest version of [SwarmPAL](https://github.com/Swarm-DISC/SwarmPAL)

## Finding the demo notebooks

Once JupyterLab has loaded, you can use the file browser on the left to navigate into the `guides` directory and select a notebook.

Or use these links (though they may be outdated):
- [Shared Components](./guides/quickstart.ipynb)
- [FAC](./guides/toolboxes/fac/intro_fac.ipynb)
- [DSECS](.guides/toolboxes/dsecs/intro_dsecs.ipynb)
- [TFA](.guides/toolboxes/tfa/intro_tfa.ipynb)

These notebooks are also used to generate parts of [the online documentation](https://swarmpal.readthedocs.io)
